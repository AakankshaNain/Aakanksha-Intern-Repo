**Why is automated testing important in software development?**
1. It identifies the bug at early stage during development phase.
2. When the new code changes are integrated, it ensures the old functionalities are not affected.
3. It helps to maintain quality of the code as there is automated testing. In case of manual testing, some cases may be left to test.

**What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?**
1. When importing the Sum component, I wrote './components/Sum' and it gave me error 'cannot find module'. since it required '../components/Sum'.
2. Not necessarily challenging, it was quite easy to start with a small function.
