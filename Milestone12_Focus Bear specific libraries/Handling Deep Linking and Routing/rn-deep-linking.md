**What are the benefits of deep linking in mobile apps?**
1. It provides a smoother user experience, as the users will be directed to the preferred page and content quickly.
2. The performance of the app will be improved with smooth transitions without any interruption.
3. Through deep link notifications, the users will be directed to the specific page, improving the users engagement with the app.

**How does React Navigation handle deep linking?**
1. By using the linking module from React Native, deep linking can be achieved.
2. Then, set the URL for the screens that will be used to navigate when using deep linking.
3. The deep link is accessed through 'exp://Address:PortNumber/--/, which is displayed when the app is run.
4. It then redirects to the page specified in the link.
5. This can be achieved when the app is open, running in the background, or even when the app is closed.

**What challenges might arise when implementing deep linking?**
1. There can be a case that instead of redirecting to the specified page, it just navigates to the home page.
2. Platform-specific issues can arise.
3. There can be times when the pages are removed. In such cases, deep links can lead to users' confusion.

## Deep Linking

```
const linking = {
  prefixes: ["myreactapp://"],
  config: {
    screens: {
      Home: "home",
      Details: "details/", 
    },
  },
};
```
