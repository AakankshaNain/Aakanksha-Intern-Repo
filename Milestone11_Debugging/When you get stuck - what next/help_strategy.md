**When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?**
1. I prefer using AI when I need a quick explanation on a specific topic, whereas I use searching on Google when I need a detailed explanation and I have time to explore more.
2. Sometimes, code provides only an error code or a little description, and then I use AI.
3. I prefer Google sites like Stack Overflow, where sometimes a fix is provided for a code and also alternatives by a bunch of people who might be facing the same issues.

**How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?**
1. When I have spent a lot of time to understand a particular issue or topic, I prefer asking my colleagues.
2. During the milestone's progress, I have faced a couple of issues where I was stuck. Even after spending too much time, when I was not able to proceed, I preferred asking my colleagues.
3. Some concepts and issues are specific to the company. In such cases, I do prefer asking colleagues instead of using AI.

**What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?**
1. Sometimes, a lot of time is spent to resolve an issue.
2. Developers miss out on alternatives for some fixes, which may be more efficient.
3. They get stuck during debugging because they may be trying to debug in the same way for a particular issue.
