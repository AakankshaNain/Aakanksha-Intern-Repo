**What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**
1. Focus Bear uses the AI sensing to block the distractions related to the target the user is trying to achieve.
2. It provides the ability to build habits in a routine along with the deep sessions.

**If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**
1. Focus Bear provides a to-do list, which makes it easier to track the tasks according to their priority.
2. Also, Focus Bear is compatible with multiple devices, which makes it easier to use.
3. Focus Bear is a more focus-oriented tool, which helps to complete the target along with breaks, making it stress-free.

**What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**
Cold Turkey and Freedom provide pure distraction blocking, which in some cases may be necessary for focus.
Tiimo is more like a manual planner. There is a widget option, Routinery, that lets the user start with the Routinery directly. But in the case of Focus Bear, clicking the widget opens the app. 

**Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?**
I installed Focus Bear and worked on setting the plan. I tried a case of setting the plan and blocking the distractions by leaving in between and then continuing after some time. I found that in the middle of setting up the plan, if I closed the app and came again, it worked. But when I left while blocking the distraction apps and I came back after closing the app, it got stuck. I tried saving the changes, but it was going nowhere. I uninstalled the app and logged in again, and then it worked fine. So, maybe there are some cases that may need improvement.
