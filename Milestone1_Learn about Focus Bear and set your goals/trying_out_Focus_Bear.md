**What was your first impression of the app?**
It was interesting for me to find an app that helps to focus and avoid distractions. The app was easy to understand, but I think it may need more UI improvements and make it more engaging.

**Did you find anything difficult to understand?**
I installed Focus Bear and worked on setting the plan. I tried a case of setting the plan and blocking the distractions by leaving in between and then continuing after some time. I found that in the middle of setting up the plan, if I close the app and come again, it works. But when I left while blocking the distraction apps and I came back after closing the app, it got stuck. I tried saving the changes, but it was going nowhere. I uninstalled the app and logged in again, and then it worked fine.

**If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?**
If you need an app to feel positive at the end of the day and make the day more productive, this is the right app.

**What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?**
1. The color combinations on the 'Habits' page when 'Blocking' is not enabled. It shows one message on top of the page with the link separately; maybe it can be at the end of the line. The other message below was in bright red color. I feel the red color can be toned down a little bit to blend it with the base color of the app.
2. Maybe changing the font styles would make it more interactive with the user.
3. Also, I find the 'Hi Username' message, where username is something we can set, as it will be more engaging for the users.
