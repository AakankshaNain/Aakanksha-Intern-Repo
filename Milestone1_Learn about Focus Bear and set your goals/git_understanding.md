**What caused the conflict?**
When the same file was changed in the main and the 'Git_Practice' branch, and then the changes were tried to be merged into the main branch, it caused a merge conflict.

**How did you resolve it?**
When I opened the file and switched to the main branch to merge, the file asked me to select the option of which version to keep. I selected the main branch version and proceeded with the merge. I had some committed changes without conflicts from before, which were merged along with the conflicted file.

**What did you learn?**
Merge conflicts give a good chance to review the changes and resolve any issues found. This can be really helpful when working in a team and multiple members are making changes on the same file. The changes can be reviewed of what and why those changes were made before merging.
