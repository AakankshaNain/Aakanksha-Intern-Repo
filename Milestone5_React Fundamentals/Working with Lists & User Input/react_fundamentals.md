**What are some common issues when working with lists in React?**

1. One of the issue I faced was- while displaying the list, the bullet points were not printed. I found this tailwindcss class 'list-inside', which helps to print the bullet points inside the list box.
2. Another common issue I found was how to modify the list. The correct way would be - setList([...list, text]).
3. The lists should consist of key that uniquely identifies them.
4. An empty text is not entered in the list.
