**What makes a good commit message?**
A well structure message consisting of the bug number(if exists), what and why change is made. These factors contribute to a good commit message. 

**How does a clear commit message help in team collaboration?**
A clear commit message helps the team to easily track the changes for future use. If there is a bug, the team can easily track when and why the change was made, thus finding out the reason for bug. Additionally, when a specific code review is required, the team can easily understand the changes in the code.

**How can poor commit messages cause issues later?**
It will be difficult to track changes with no clear message of what and why these changes were made. Some of the bad commit messages I saw were -  'update', 'cleanup', 'Another 3 added', these messages didn't give me the clear idea of the changes. Also, not only it will be difficult to remember for the associate who made the change, but other developers can also find it hard to why a change was made.
