**Why are PRs important in a team workflow?**
PRs are important since they allow to review the code and issues by the team members. If a team member has a doubt before merging the change to the main branch, a reviewer can be assigned to make sure the changes are correct. Also, PRs consist of all the track and well-structured reasoning of the changes made.

**What makes a well-structured PR?**
A well-structured PR is the one:
1. It has a short but descriptive title consisting of the changes made.
2. A description where the reason for the changes and what changes are done are well documented.
3. All the commit messages in the pull request are well-structured including the issue number, the reason for change, and where the changes are made.
4. All the changes are thoroughly tested before merging in the main branch.
5. If required, reviewers are assigned for verifying the changes before merging.

**What did you learn from reviewing an open-source PR?**
1. A meaningful title and description are essential for the PR.
2. Reviewers are attached wherever necessary.
3. There were PRs where test cases were attached and some suggested code changes to avoid future errors.
