# How can keyboard shortcuts improve productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts help save time. Instead of selecting the required text and then right-clicking, tasks can be performed directly through clicking keys on keyboard.
I have faced many situations when I am trying to do some task through the mouse, and get stuck when mouse or keypad isn't working. This can be avoided in some cases where shortcuts are available.
