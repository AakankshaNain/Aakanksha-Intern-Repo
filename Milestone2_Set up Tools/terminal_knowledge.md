**Which terminal client did you choose? Why?**
I chose Windows+Powershell, because I have done CMD before and I know few commands. So, it will be easy to learn how different Powershell is.

**What customizations (if any) did you make?**
I have Windows Terminal set to Powershell, but not other than that. I'll try to add customization as I practice it more.

**What was the most useful command you learned today?**
The basic commands of Powershell, like creating (New-Item), opening (Start-Process) and removing (Remove-Item) a file. Learning only these three commands made me realise Powershell commands are more easy to understand.
