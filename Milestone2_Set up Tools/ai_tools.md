# *Tasks*

**Which AI tools did you try?**
I installed extension GitHub Copilot on my VS Code. I tried to find ChatGpt extension for VS Code, but it showed many suggestions and among them I was not sure which was the correct one.

**What worked well? What didnâ€™t?**
I tried all the tasks generating code snippets by writing comment and it was automatically giving me suggestions.
Next, I tried to check the issue with my code. For a simple function whether a number is even or odd, I changed Modulo to Multiplication function and changed return to 'retur'. Then I asked to /fix and /explain why my code was not running, it gave me suggestions. I also tried to ask in CoPilot chat to explain why my code was not performing well. Next, I used Copilot chat to learn about Redux basics, and then I asked more about reducer in it.
I have a attached a screenshot of it.

**When do you think AI is most useful for coding?**
By trying AI on a simple function, I found it interesting that when I may get stuck on fixing some issue even after checking it multiple times on my own, I can ask GitHub Copilot to explain it. Also, when I am coding on a new functionality and may want to know how about some new function works, Copilot chat can be helpful with that.
