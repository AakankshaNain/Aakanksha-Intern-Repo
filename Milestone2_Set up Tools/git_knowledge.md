# Research GIT Basics

**Have you used Git before?**
Yes, I have. In my last semester I used it during my group project. We used to track our source code changes, as we created three different branches and then merged it when the test cases were passed.

**Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?**
I chose Git command terminal and Git VS Code, because I am comfortable with command terminal even though I have to still learn git commands and Git VS Code because I practice most of the code on VS Code and it will be easy to get familiar with.

**What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?**
I find it interesting that I will be using Git VS Code more, since I used it before but it was for the first time. Now I can learn more about and how to use it.
