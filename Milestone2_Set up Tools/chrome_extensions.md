# Tasks

**Which extensions did you install? Why?**
I installed these extensions: ReduxDevTools, JSON Formatter by Callumlocke, and Lighthouse, and I already had React Developer Tools extension. These extensions will be beneficial for the tasks related to development of the app.

**What was the most useful thing you learned?**
These extensions will make the development easier as I got to know the JSON Formatter will help formatting JSON data more clearly when debugging the API responses.
