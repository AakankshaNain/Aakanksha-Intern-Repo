# REFLECTION

- **What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**

  1. _Strong Password_: I keep the passwords following the format of combination of characters, digits, and special symbols. I don't use password manager which may be a good practice to adapt.
  2. _Avoid Phishing Attacks_: I avoid opening the links that look suspicious. Even, I avoid opening such emails when I look on the subjects.
  3. _Protect Device_: I keep my device updated and secured with password. There are some notifications which I usually ignore, so they can be kept at with.
  4. _2-step-authentication_: This measure I have followed in each of my account.

- **How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**

  1. Starting with using password manager whenever I can, which helps to avoid reusing the same password across all accounts.
  2. Keep up with the updates in the device, and backing it regularly. Maybe using auto-update in devices and setting an auto-backup so that the important data is not.
  3. Securing the network(Wifi) which I connect to by disabling the auto-connect to Wifi. Additionally, avoiding not connecting to the unknown Wifi networks.
  4. Avoiding opening the links from unknown people and companies never heard of, and the subject feels something like is just a phishing attack.
     By following these steps regularly, I can definitely achieve making it a habit to be secure.

- **What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?**

  1. First step is to make a strong password, and ensure not use same password across all accounts.
  2. Using the password manager for generating the secure password, and auto-fill for passwords which helps to avoid manually entering the password in dubious sites.
  3. The use of two-step authentication can be enabled in all accounts. In case a password is compromised, the second layer of protection using the contact number or email can secure the account.
  4. Updating and reviewing the password on a regular basis can help avoid hacking into accounts.

- **What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?**
  This type of situation occurred to me in the past where I followed these steps:
  1. First, I went on to reset my password, a strong and different with the last one.
  2. After resetting the password, I logged out of all my account from all of the devices.
  3. Next step was to check all my details were correct, and no changes were done to my account.
  4. Added a two-step-authentication on my account to make it more secure.
  5. I emailed the account provider about the suspected access to my account.
  6. Since then, I have kept a regular check on all of my accounts if they are updated with the required details ensuring my accounts are protected.
