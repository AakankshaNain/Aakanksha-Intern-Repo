**What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)**
1. Starting with adjusting my chair so that my eyes are at the level of the screen device and my knees are at 90 degrees angle.
2. Get a laptop stand to avoid slouching.
3. Getting a keyboard and mouse for better positioning of the hand.

**What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)**
1. Following a 20-20-20 rule, every 20 minutes-look 20 feet away-for 20 seconds. This reduces eye strain.
2. Doing stretching at regular intervals.
3. Sitting with a straight back so that there is no neck strain.
4. By adjusting the screen height so that it is at eye level.

**How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)**
1. Through phone reminders, like setting a clock to remind to take regular breaks in between work.
2. By using Focus Bear, which provides a reminder to stretch and take breaks at regular intervals.
