# REFLECTION

**When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?**

1. While writing code, if you are understanding the concepts, you can easily achieve the functionality from the code written by you. Sometimes AI tools provide complex solutions, but if the concept is clear, the problem can be solved in a comparatively less complex way.
2. There are AI tools to check the writing skills. Here, relying on your skills is better, but AI tools can be looked for help in order to review the task written. Sometimes, even small errors go unnoticed.

**How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?**

1. When coding, I face issues that I may not be aware of, so, in this case, checking the error of why it is occurring can be beneficial. But before that, brainstorming on the error occurred will help me with over-relying on AI tool. If I face the same issue in future, I will know how to start resolving it.
2. While writing a new code for a new functionality requires a lot of effort. So, a shortcut can be directly getting an idea from AI without even giving it a try. This leads to over-relying, which can help right now but destroys critical thinking. This can be avoided by first thinking about how to achieve it, writing the code and when faced with an error can take help of AI tool.
3. AI tool may also help in code reviewing, give better approach. This will help in understanding what changes can be made in the code written, but directly copying and pasting the whole code suggested by the AI tool should be avoided.
4. AI tool can help in planning the path to learn new concepts. Then looking into each resource and deciding whether it is beneficial or not, has to be the final decision made my us.

**What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**

1. First, not sharing the personal information with the AI tool, like account information.
2. While coding, not sharing the whole project code. Maybe sharing 2-3 statements is okay to identify the issue.
3. Making sure the permissions are set to private mode for sharing the data, and reviewing the terms and conditions of AI tool.
4. Installing the AI tool locally for safe practice and avoiding data leaks.
