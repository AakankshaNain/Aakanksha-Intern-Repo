# User Manual for Aakanksha Nain

**My role**
- *I am working on*: 
  1. The milestones provided, currently on 'React Fundamentals' and 'Company Policies'.
  2. In Focus Bear, as a mobile developer intern as soon as I complete milestones.
- *The days and times I work are*:
  1. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 10am-6pm.
  2. Sometimes do my research on work tasks on weekends.

**How I Work Best**
- *I do my best work when*:
  1. I have my work organized, what tasks are left, and what next I have to pick up.
  2. I am understanding the task I have.
  3. I am not doing overwork, and I have had my proper rest.
- *I struggle when*
  1. The work is not of my interest.
  2. I have my mind somewhere else.
  3. I get stuck even trying multiple times. In such cases, I usually leave that work (if not a priority), and start other task. But if its priority, I take around half hour break and start again. Also, I ask for help if it's still not resolved.

**Communication Style**
- *I prefer messages to be*: (e.g., short and direct, detailed, async, verbal)
  1. Direct, instead of them being vague. That makes them easy to understand and identify the issue.
  2. All questions in one 
- *The best way to reach me is*: (e.g., Discord, email, scheduled calls)
  1. On emails: I keep a check on emails, even on non-working days.
  2. Discord: I am active on discord on my working days.
- *If you need something urgent, do this*:
  1. Email me, if I don't reply within half hour, call me (share your contact details with me, I generally avoid unknown calls).

**Collaboration & Teamwork**
- *I work best in a team when*:
  1. Everyone put their suggestions clearly.
  2. All are contributing in the team, since in case of big issues it can be tiring for one person to handle.
- *My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is*:
  1. When someone is assigned a task, and disappears without informing (in all cases) and delegating task to someone else (in high priority cases).
- *If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means*:
  1. It's taking me time to understand the topic, and I am making my notes on what I have to work on.
  2. I have my mind elsewhere.

**Focus & Productivity**
- *I stay focused by*:
  1. Playing music on earphones and doing my work.
- *Things that distract me*:
  1. Calls without informing in non-urgent cases. Message me.
  2. I suddenly start thinking of something else. 
- *The best way to support my productivity is*:
  1. By explaining me the task clearly, and if there are any changes inform me beforehand.
  2. When I know the deadlines.

**Feedback & Growth**
- *I like feedback to be*: (e.g., direct, gentle, with examples, public/private)
  1. Always in private, but if everyone is been given feedback then in public.
  2. Direct but in a kind way.
- *When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is*:
  1. Message me, I'll correct it and inform you as soon as I can.
- *I appreciate it when teammates*:
  1. Have worked through the ideas together.
  2. Share something with me that I need to improve in, but through one-to-one communication.

**Fun Facts & Quirks**
- *One thing people often misunderstand about me is*:
  1. I always like to be on my own, but that case is only when I am focused and working on something. I love to interact with people, and know about them.
- *A fun fact about me*:
  1. When I am full on my thoughts, I write them. Also, I do swimming or singing to relax and avoid unnecessary thoughts.
  2. I sometimes sing when I feel I am losing my focus on work.
- *My work superpower is*:
  1. I manage my work by being organized.
  2. I keep everything in writing, my to-do-tasks, the tasks I have completed, and most of the times I keep a document of the issues I mostly face.
