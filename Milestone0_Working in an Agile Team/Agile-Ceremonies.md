**How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?**
1. *Daily Stand-ups*: They help to keep the track of the progress of the tasks. If any team member is facing blockers, that will be known to everyone in the team. There can be someone else in the team who might be facing same issue.
2. *Sprint-Planning(Scrum) or Continuous Prioritization(Kanban)*: The planning of the delivering tasks can be discussed here. All the team members can be aligned the tasks according to the goals.
3. *Retrospectives*: The meeting where team members can get feedback and help in improving for the future tasks.
4. *Backlog Refinement*: All the tasks are well structured, and helps in prioritizing and reviewing the tasks easily. 

**Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?**
As a developer, I think daily stand-ups are the most important ceremony for my role. This will help to know the progress of the development of the product, all the ongoing and planned tasks of each team member. I may get stuck with a bug, which I can communicate with my team and get assistance with it.
