# Reflection

**What do you think are the biggest *benefits and challenges of Agile*?**
*Benefits*
1. The flexibility to adapt the change even during the late phase of development.
2. The preferred communication medium is the face-to-face communication, which helps to more open up about the issues the associate is facing.
3. The daily standups which help to track about the tasks done and goals for the day, benefits to the team a lot. It helps to keep everyone in the team updated about how many tasks are still left and then plan accordingly to finish according to the timeline. 
*Challenges*
1. Since, Agile supports continuous communication between teams, it can be difficult for large teams and organizations to keep track all the time.
2. All the requirements are discussed at the start, so with coming changes it can be a challenge to meet up with the new requirements. 


**How can Agile principles help improve *your role and responsibilities*?**
1. Agile involves continuous feedback from the team, which can help to improve the skills.
2. When collaborating with team associates, it will ease the process of development. It will help me identify the issues faster and will make sure the product is more efficient.
3. One of the agile principle, welcoming change, will keep me responsible and help me in embracing the change. If the change requires adjusting priorities, it will be a part of my role.

# Task

**Summarize the *main differences between Scrum and Kanban* in your own words.**
1. The first difference I think of is that Scrum has specific roles in a team like- Scrum Master, Product Owner. But, Kanban has no such specific roles.
2. Scrum follows fixed-length sprints, including all sprint planning, sprint retrospective. But, Kanban has a continuous flow of work.
3. The changes are not done between a sprint in Scrum, whereas, in Kanban since there is no sprint, the changes are welcomed during the development of the product.
4. Same as the changes, deliveries of the product are planned continuously when required in Kanban. But, in Scrum, deliverables are according to the sprints.

**Identify one *Agile principle* you think will be most useful in your work.**
The most useful Agile principle I can think of is the continuous feedback I'll be getting from the team which will improve my technical skills as well as working in a team as whole. These will help to identify the areas I am lacking in and I can improve in them.
