**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**
1. According to the priorities, the tasks can be moved on Kanban board. If there are some blocked tasks that require immediate attention, they can be moved to the in-progress column and worked on. Similarly, if any task is in To Do column and has high priority, the team member can pull the task and move in the in-progress column.
2. If there are too many tasks in the in-progress column that has led to overloading the work, the team members can check the tasks that can be resolved early. These tasks can be moved to 'Review/Testing' and 'Done' once all the requirements have been completed.

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**
1. By limiting the work in progress, that is not working on a large number of tasks at a time. This will help not to create workload, which often to leads to product inefficiency.
2. Continuously tracking the changes and tasks, and using feedback to improve the approach to tasks in future.
3. By regularly attending the stand-up meetings to keep up with the status of the tasks, and discuss any blockers if required.
4. By collaboratively working with the team and managing the priorities of the tasks according to the need of the product.
