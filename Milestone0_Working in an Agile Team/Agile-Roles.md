# Reflection

**What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?**
My role is of developer, and as a developer I will contribute as follows according to the Agile process:
1. I attend the daily standups, and other meetings for continuous updates on the status of the tasks.
2. Collaborate with the other roles, to develop an efficient product.
3. I implement changes based on the feedback provided by my team to ensure working and user-friendly product is delivered.

**How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?**
As a developer, I have to collaborate with QA team, Product Manager, UX team, and other developers to make sure the product is meeting all the requirements and working efficiently.
1. After developing a requirement, QA team tests and makes sure all the test cases pass.
   If there is some issue with test cases, based on QA team's feedback, I will refine the performance of the product.
2. If I am unsure of the requirements, I'll discuss with the Product Manager to clearly understand the functional and technical requirements.
3. Working with UX team will make sure I develop a user-friendly product.
4. Whenever I am stuck with some technical challenge - either with a bug or I require code review, I can discuss with other developers. 
   Additionally, a complex task can be completed by working in pairs if required.

# Task

**Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.**
As a developer I will understand the product requirements, develop, design, and even do unit testing before passing onto the QA team. When collaborating with other roles,
I will assure a continuous delivery of an efficient and working product, that meets the customer requirements.

**Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.**
I'll frequently collaborate with the QA team. The developing and testing of the product, especially new changes have to be handled carefully. Since, some of the new changes
can affect the old functionality, and testing by QA team makes sure the product is working efficiently. By maintaining good teamwork with QA team, the number of defects can be
closed on time, leading in a continuous delivery.
